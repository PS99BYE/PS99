# Tutorial for Dupe & Trade Glitch
## How does this work?
This script works by sending invalid packets to the Pet Simulator 99 servers, causing them to not be able to store new data. Anything you do from this point on can and will be reverted.
### Dupe
What you need
- An alt
- Another method of joining the game
- 10k+ gems + stuff you want to dupe

This method utilizes the mailbox and the script.

!!!EXECUTE THE SCRIPT WHEN YOU JOIN!!!

Simply send any item you want to dupe to your alt account (AFTER EXECUTING SCRIPT)

When you leave and rejoin, your items will still be there, however they will still be sent to your alt.

!!DO NOT!!
Join the same game as your alt.

This will delete the duped item. You must sell this item before joining a server with your main, then you can transfer diamonds/ other goods you got.

### Trade Glitch

Don't have any good items? Well this is the glitch for you

What you need

- An item with ANY value at all

This method utilizes other people.

!!!EXECUTE THE SCRIPT WHEN YOU JOIN!!!

Give them a great offer that they can't refuse, accept the trade, but quickly unaccept. Take away all the items you put in.

On their screen all the items will still be there, however you will not lose any items, but gain theirs.

REPEAT FOR INFINITE WEALTH
